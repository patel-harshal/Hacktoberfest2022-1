To add two matrices-:

Ans-a = [[15,7,3],
                 [4 ,50,6],
                 [7 ,8,90]]
 b = [[5,8,1],
        [6,7,3],
       [4,5,9]]
result = [[0,0,0],
                   [0,0,0],
                 [0,0,0]]

for i in range(len(a)):
 for j in range(len(a[0])):
 result[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j]
for c in result:
 print(c)

Output-
[17, 15, 4]
[10, 12, 9]
[11, 13, 18]
